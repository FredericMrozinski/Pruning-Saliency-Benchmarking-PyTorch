For the script to run, you need to download the ImageNet dataset as provided by [ImageNet](https://image-net.
org/download-images.php) and place it here. We ran this script with `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar` but you may of course use
other versions. Just ensure that you adapt the file-name/-location in `src/main.py`.
